Starting new Xamarin online course on Udemy called Xamarin Forms for Android and iOS Native Development.

Doing a new course called Xamarin Forms for Android and iOS Native Development. There is a much better walkthrough of how to use Xamarin.

Going to hit the b asics of Navigation pages, SQLite, and using Nuget packages. Seems to be similar to the app that the other how-to guide used
This one seems so far to be better.

I have the front-end functioanlity working now. About to start the back-end.
