Starting new Xamarin online course on Udemy called Xamarin Forms for Android and iOS Native Development.

Doing a new course called Xamarin Forms for Android and iOS Native Development. There is a much better walkthrough of how to use Xamarin.

Going to hit the b asics of Navigation pages, SQLite, and using Nuget packages. Seems to be similar to the app that the other how-to guide used
This one seems so far to be better.

I have the front-end functioanlity working now. About to start the back-end.

So use SQLite, you need to find a place to save it. iOS and Android are different in terms of where you can save files.
Therefore some additional code has been saved in AppDelagate.cs in iOS and MainActivity.cs in Android.
